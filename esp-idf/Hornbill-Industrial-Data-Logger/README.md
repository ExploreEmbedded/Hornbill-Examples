# esp32 aws iot Data Logger
ESP32 template for connecting to the AWS IoT platform

Please make sure you have read the [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started/) before trying to do anyting with this template.

This template is based on and contains the code from the [aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C) project with an ESP32 port. It may help to review that project before attempting to use this template.

The following files and directory require modification based on your WIFI settings and the configuration created in the IoT console:

```
main/main.c
main/include/aws_iot_config.h
main/certs
```

*main/main.c:*

This is where your WIFI information will need to be set. It also contains a
function called "record_temp_task" that contains the code used data using the
AWS IoT SDK.

```
#define WIFI_SSID "WIFI SSID"
#define WIFI_PASS "WIFI PASSWORD"
```

*main/include/aws_iot_config.h:*

This file needs to be modified to match the information given in the AWS IoT 
console. Follow the instructions given in the getting started guide to figure
out what to put here.

```
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST              "something.amazonaws.com"
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT              8883
#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_CLIENT_ID         "SomeClientID"
#define AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME          "SomeThingName"
```

*main/certs:*

This directory needs to contain the root cert and the certs generated by the
AWS IoT console. Follow the instructions given in the getting started guide to
build these. They must match the names here exactly.

```
  root-CA.crt
  certificate.pem.crt
  private.pem.key
```
