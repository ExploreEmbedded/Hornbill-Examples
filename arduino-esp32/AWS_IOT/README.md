# Arduino-esp32-aws-iot
Arduini ESP32 library for AWS IoT

Please make sure you have read the [getting started guide](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/getting-started/) before trying to do anyting with this template.

This template is based on and contains the code from the [aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C) project with an ESP32 port. It may help to review that project before attempting to use this template.

Define the below parameters in the sketch:
```
WIFI_SSID
WIFI_PASSWORD
HOST_ADDRESS
CLIENT_ID
TOPIC_NAME
```


*Certificates*
```
  root-CA.crt
  certificate.pem.crt
  private.pem.key
```
Above certificates needs to be stored in the file aws_iot_certificates.c as arrays. Check the file for more information.
